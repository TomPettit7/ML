All of my ML projects to date. 

Numpy - NN written only with the library Numpy /n
OpenAI - NN written to work within OpenAI gym environments /n
Simple - Very simple pre-programmed classifiers /n
Tensorflow - NN written with the library Tensorflow /n

***NOTE***
OpenAI is written with TFLearn as it is a much easier way of writing NN algorithms
